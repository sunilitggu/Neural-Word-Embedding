Softmax For Neural Word Embeddings

ORIGINAL MATLAB CODE:
http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/csc321/assignment1.html

This is a rough python implementation of a neural word embedding model that uses a softmax classifier in the last layer to predict
the probability of a fourth word coming after a trigram (or three words).

E.g.
Given:
  ['The', 'dog', 'is'] 
Predict:
  The probability that a word comes after
